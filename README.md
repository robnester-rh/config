# Enterprise Contract Configuration Files

This repo contains a set of `policy.yaml` files which can be used by the [Conforma
Command Line Interface](https://github.com/conforma/cli) with a variety of
environments.

## Konflux CI

When using Red Hat's [Konflux CI](https://github.com/konflux-ci/)
environment, there is a predefined Integration Test pipeline definition for each of the configs in
this section. They can be used when creating an Integration Test in Konflux as per the [documentation
here](https://konflux-ci.dev/docs/advanced-how-tos/managing-compliance-with-ec/).

The policy configuration files are:

### Default

Includes rules for levels 1, 2 & 3 of SLSA v0.1. This is the default config used for new Konflux applications.

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/conforma/config//default`
* Source: [default/policy.yaml](https://github.com/conforma/config/blob/main/default/policy.yaml)
* Collections: [@slsa3](https://conforma.dev/docs/policy/release_policy.html#slsa3)

### Red Hat

Includes the full set of rules and policies required internally by Red Hat when building Red Hat products.

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/conforma/config//redhat`
* Source: [redhat/policy.yaml](https://github.com/conforma/config/blob/main/redhat/policy.yaml)
* Collections: [@redhat](https://conforma.dev/docs/policy/release_policy.html#redhat)

### Red Hat (non hermetic)

Includes most of the rules and policies required internally by Red Hat when building Red Hat products. It excludes the requirement of hermetic builds.

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/conforma/config//redhat-no-hermetic`
* Source: [redhat-no-hermetic/policy.yaml](https://github.com/conforma/config/blob/main/redhat-no-hermetic/policy.yaml)
* Collections: [@redhat](https://conforma.dev/docs/policy/release_policy.html#redhat)

### Red Hat RPMs

For Red Hat RPM builds in Red Hat Konflux.

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/conforma/config//redhat-rpms`
* Source: [redhat-rpms/policy.yaml](https://github.com/conforma/config/blob/main/redhat-rpms/policy.yaml)
* Collections: [@redhat_rpms](https://conforma.dev/docs/policy/release_policy.html#redhat_rpms)

### SLSA3

Rules specifically related to levels 1, 2 & 3 of SLSA v0.1, plus a set of basic checks that are expected to pass for all Konflux builds.

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/conforma/config//slsa3`
* Source: [slsa3/policy.yaml](https://github.com/conforma/config/blob/main/slsa3/policy.yaml)
* Collections: [@minimal](https://conforma.dev/docs/policy/release_policy.html#minimal), [@slsa3](https://conforma.dev/docs/policy/release_policy.html#slsa3)


## Stable (versioned policies)

The main branch of the [conforma/policy](https://github.com/conforma/policy)
is always tested with the [latest build of ec](https://github.com/conforma/cli/releases). If
your environment uses a specific version of ec, such as
[the official Red Hat build](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/rhtas/ec-rhel9/65f1f9dcfc649a18c6075de5),
then you can use one of these instead of the
[main branch default](https://github.com/conforma/config?tab=readme-ov-file#default).

They are similar to the [Konflux CI "default"](#default) configuration except they use a specific branch
of the policies repo for stability and compatiblity with specific verisons of ec. These configurations are
suggested for use in [Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline](https://developers.redhat.com/products/trusted-application-pipeline/overview) templates.

The policy configuration files are:

### Default (v0.4)

Includes rules for levels 1, 2 & 3 of SLSA v0.1. For use with ec version v0.4

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/conforma/config//default-v0.4`
* Source: [default-v0.4/policy.yaml](https://github.com/conforma/config/blob/main/default-v0.4/policy.yaml)
* Collections: [@slsa3](https://conforma.dev/docs/policy/release_policy.html#slsa3)

### RHTAP

Includes rules suitable for use with the attestations created by RHTAP.

* URL for Enterprise Contract: `github.com/conforma/config//rhtap-v0.6`
* Source: [rhtap-v0.6/policy.yaml](https://github.com/conforma/config/blob/main/rhtap-v0.6/policy.yaml)
* Collections: [@rhtap-multi-ci](https://conforma.dev/docs/policy/release_policy.html#rhtap-multi-ci)

considered trusted.

The policy configuration files are:
